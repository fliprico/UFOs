# UFOs

## Project Overview

In this module, we begin our JavaScript journey by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. We create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results

Our webpage has been modified to have a filter for several search criterias. We created a row to filter our search results by "Date", "City", "State" "Country", "Shape" which provides us with some flexibility to narrow down specifics of our UFO search.

## Summary
* A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields.
Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
* One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis.
